#   ./build.sh                              # normal build
#   ./build.sh -DRGBX_STRICT_TOOLCHAIN=ON   # CI: pin deviations are fatal
#   ./build.sh -DRGBX_SDK_SOURCE_DIR=<dir>  # build against a local SDK tree
#   ./build.sh -URGBX_NODE                  # re-detect node after upgrading it
#
# (This wrapper exists instead of a CMake workflow preset because workflow
# presets need CMake >= 3.25 and the project supports 3.21.)

# it (the SDK's find_program covers both of those targets); this looks at the
